    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I have a more old-school background in traditional System Administration, first using RedHat Linux & FreeBSD in 1999. As a System Administrator I have overseen the management of essential infrastructure components, including Backup, Database, Mail, and Web servers, among others, serving as the workhorses that support various online services and platforms. In my current position, I handle DevOps responsibilities, looking to “automate all the things”.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I am a perpetual student always learning. I have also maintained packages for OmniOS (<a href="https://omnios.org">https://omnios.org</a>), an open-source fork of the Sun Microsystems Solaris operating system. When I am not on my computer I enjoy outdoor activities.
